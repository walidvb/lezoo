#drush setmeup


drush setmeup is a small project meant to facilitate my life as a independant drupaler. Idea is to set two installations up with one command, one local and one remote, with aliases, and ready to get rolling.
Roadmap is:

-install on both
-send tmp link from remote server to allow user-login
