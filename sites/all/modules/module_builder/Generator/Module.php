   *   (optional) An array of data for the module. The properties are as
   *   follows:
   *    - 'base': The type of component: 'module'.
   *    - 'module_root_name': The machine name for the module.
   *    - 'module_readable_name': The human readable name for the module.
   *    - 'module_short_description': The module's description text.
   *    - 'module_help_text': Help text for the module. If this is given, then
   *       hook_help() is automatically added to the list of required hooks.
   *    - 'hooks': An associative array whose keys are full hook names
   *      (eg 'hook_menu'), where requested hooks have a value of TRUE.
   *      Unwanted hooks may also be included as keys provided their value is
   *      FALSE.
   *    - 'module_dependencies': A string of module dependencies, separated by
   *       spaces, e.g. 'forum views'.
   *    - 'module_package': The module package.
   *    - 'component_folder': (optional) The destination folder to write the
   *      module files to.
   *    - 'module_files': ??? OBSOLETE!? added by this function. A flat array
   *      of filenames that have been generated.
   *    - 'requested_build': An array whose keys are names of subcomponents to
   *       build. Component names are defined in subComponents(), and include:
   *       - 'all': everything we can do.
   *       - 'code': PHP code files.
   *       - 'info': the info file.
   *       - 'module': the .module file.
   *       - 'install': the .install file.
   *       - 'tests': test file.
   *       - 'api': api.php hook documentation file.
   *       - FILE ID: requests a particular code file, by the abbreviated name.
   *         This is the filename without the initial 'MODULE.' or the '.inc'
   *         extension.
   *    - 'requested_components': An array of components to build (in addition
   *      to any that are added automatically). This should in the same form
   *      as the return from subComponents(), thus keyed by component name,
   *      with values either a component type or an array of data.
   *  Properties added by generators during the process:
   *    - 'hook_file_data': Added by the Hooks generator. Keyed by the component
   *      names of the ModuleCodeFile type components that Hooks adds.
